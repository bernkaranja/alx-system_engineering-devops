<h1>The Journey of Typing https://www.google.com in Your Browser</h1>
<p1>When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a series of behind-the-scenes processes take place to deliver the web page you're requesting. Let's take a closer look at what happens step by step:
DNS Request: The first step is the Domain Name System (DNS) request. Your browser sends a request to a DNS server to translate the human-readable URL "www.google.com" into an IP address, which is a unique numerical identifier used by computers to locate web servers on the internet.
TCP/IP: Once the DNS server returns the IP address of the web server associated with "www.google.com", your browser establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures reliable data transmission, while IP determines the routing of data packets across the internet.
Firewall: The data packets containing your request and the response from the web server pass through various network devices, including firewalls. Firewalls act as a security barrier and filter incoming and outgoing traffic to protect against unauthorized access.</p1>

<p2>HTTPS/SSL: If the website you're accessing, such as Google, uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), your browser establishes a secure connection using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. SSL/TLS encrypts the data exchanged between your browser and the web server, ensuring that it's protected from interception and tampering.
Load-balancer: Many popular websites, including Google, use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers. Load balancers optimize resource allocation and ensure high availability and performance of the website.
Web Server: The load balancer forwards your request to one of the web servers hosting the website. The web server receives the request, processes it, and generates a response. It may also execute scripts, retrieve data from databases, and perform other tasks to generate the web page.
Application Server: In some cases, web servers communicate with application servers to retrieve dynamic content, such as personalized data or user-specific information. Application servers process the request and generate the necessary data to be displayed on the web page.
Database: Web servers and application servers may interact with databases to retrieve or update data. Databases store and manage the website's data, such as user accounts, product information, and more.</p2>

<p3>Once the web server, application server, and/or database have processed the request and generated the response, it is sent back to your browser via the same series of steps. Your browser receives the response, renders the web page, and displays it for you to see.
Understanding the journey of a web request can help you appreciate the intricate mechanisms that power the websites we access every day on the internet.</p3>
